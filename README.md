### Build a Modern Computer from First Principles:  
  
Project 1: Boolean Functions and Gate Logic  
Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic and the ALU  
Project 3: Memory (Sequential Logic)  
Project 4: Machine Language  
Project 5: Computer Architecture  
Project 6: Assembler  
Project 7: Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic  
Project 8: Virtual Machine II: Program Control  
Project 9: High-Level Language  
Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis  
Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation  
Project 12: Operating System  

In 1-6 projects a modern computer system is built from the ground up: from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer

In 7-12 projects a modern software hierarchy is built, designed to enable the translation and execution of object-based, high-level languages on a bare-bone computer hardware platform. In particular, a virtual machine and a compiler are implemented for a simple, Java-like programming language, and a basic operating system is developed, that closes gaps between the high-level language and the underlying hardware platform.

**Key skills**: Logic Gate, Computer Architecture, Assembly Languages, Hardware Description Language (HDL), Computer Architecture, Compiler Construction, Compiler, Operating System
